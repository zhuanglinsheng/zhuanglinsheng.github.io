- Occasionally I write [blogs]({{ site.url }}/blog/) as a record of my study.
- Recently I learned to write [poems]({{ site.url }}/poem) to get some relax.
- During my Ph.D., I wrote following novels (in Chinese):
  - [Novel 1](https://fanqienovel.com/page/7168853163565386752), which is related to game theory.
  - [Novel 2](https://m.qidian.com/book/1040045469.html), which is also related to game theory.
- I also created a programming language just for fun. See [here]({{ site.url }}/2024/08/28/Tapas.html).
